# Game of Life

Implement a function that, given a two-dimensional grid of cells, each one being alive or dead, computes the next generation of cells according to the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation;
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation;
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation;
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
